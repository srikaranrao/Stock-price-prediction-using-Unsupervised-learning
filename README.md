# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Unsupervised Learning

This project explores **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to analyze and predict stock price movements.  
Instead of relying on labeled outcomes (like "buy/sell"), the model uses **clustering and feature engineering** to discover patterns and behaviors within stock market data.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- ✅ Download historical stock price data (Yahoo Finance / other APIs).  
- ✅ Generate technical indicators (returns, volatility, RSI, MACD, etc.).  
- ✅ Apply **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)** to group similar stocks.  
- ✅ Analyze market behavior patterns and visualize results.  
- ✅ Compare performance with baseline market indices (like S&P 500 / SPY).  

This approach is useful for:
- Identifying hidden structure in stock movements.  
- Grouping stocks with similar risk/return profiles.  
- Building **data-driven trading strategies** without explicit labels.
